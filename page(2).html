    <h1 align="center">pinguins</h1>
    <p align="center">Penguins are a fascinating group of aquatic,<br>
         flightless birds. They are almost exclusively<br>
          found in the Southern Hemisphere, with only a <br>
          single species, the Galapagos penguin, living <br>
          north of the equator. Known for their distinctive<br>
           black and white plumage, penguins are incredibly <br>
           well-adapted to life in the water. Their wings have<br>
            evolved into powerful flippers, and their streamlined <br>
            bodies allow them to be agile and swift swimmers, often<br>
             reaching impressive speeds while hunting for fish, squid,<br>
              and krill. On land, they have a characteristic waddling gait, <br>
              but they are surprisingly effective at navigating icy and rocky<br>
               terrain. Living in large colonies, penguins exhibit complex social<br>
                behaviors, from coordinated huddling to protect against the cold<br>
                 to elaborate courtship rituals.</p>
